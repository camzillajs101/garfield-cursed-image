  <h1>Garfield Cursed Image Gallery!</h1>

<blockquote>
  Over the past few months, I've been collecting so-called "cursed images" of Garfield, everyone's favorite Monday-hating
  comic strip cat. These are images that may be somewhat disturbing or otherworldly, or just plain strange. If you think you
  have a good image that's not already on the site, send it to me at <a href="mailto:info@garfieldcursedimage.org">info@garfieldcursedimage.org</a>.
  Otherwise, I usually find new images to add pretty often. Anyway, enjoy the nightmare fuel!

  <b><i>FULL DISCLAIMER:</i></b> I am not gaining any money whatsoever from this site, or from the images on this site.
  If you see an image here that you created, that's great! But please keep in mind that this site was created only for fun,
  as a side project to work on in my spare time. I find these images mostly on online browsing sites, or a friend sends
  them to me. I do not intend to have any monetary gain from it. Thank you.

    This site was created from scratch entirely with Ruby on Rails. I'm kinda proud of it.
